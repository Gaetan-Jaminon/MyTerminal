-- Claude Code + Zellij Integration
-- Legacy file - functionality moved to config/ directory
-- This file will be removed in future cleanup

local M = {}

-- Note: Most functionality has been moved to:
-- - config/options.lua (Zellij optimizations, auto-reload settings)
-- - config/keymaps.lua (Claude keybindings, window navigation)
-- - config/autocmds.lua (file change detection, Neo-tree auto-open)
-- - config/functions.lua (send_to_terminal and other utilities)

-- This file is kept temporarily for backward compatibility
-- and will be removed once all functionality is verified to work
